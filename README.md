# Tor Relay Measurements & Experiments

1. *get_delay.py*
2. *get_latencies.py* => Usage: *awk "FNR >= 2 && FNR <=8"  topsites.txt | python get_latencies.py Germany* ; Gets delays offered by top-100 exit nodes in a specific country.
3. *plot_cdfs* => Plot latencies. Takes the filename of the file generated by the above code and the country of the Exit Nodes under consideration.
4. *weighted_shortest_paths.py* => Implementation of LasTor's Weighted Shortest Path Algorithm.
5. *GeoLiteCity.dat* => MaxMind's Free GeoIP database (to map IPs of nodes to their approximate geographical locations)
